Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
- **XSS Protection** with React's built-in sanitization
- **HTTPS Only** in production
- **Secure Headers** via Nginx configuration

#### Backend Security
- **Input Validation** on all API endpoints
- **CORS Configuration** for cross-origin requests
- **Rate Limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Authentication** ready for future implementation

#### Container Security
- **Non-root User** execution in Docker containers
- **Minimal Base Images** (Alpine/Slim variants)
- **Resource Limits** to prevent DoS
- **Security Scanning** with Trivy in CI/CD

### Infrastructure Security

#### Docker Security
```yaml
# Security features in docker-compose.yml
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
read_only: true
tmpfs:
  - /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=100m
```

#### Network Security
- **Internal Docker Networks** for service communication
- **Port Restrictions** - only necessary ports exposed
- **Health Checks** for service monitoring

### Development Security

#### Dependency Security
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning** in CI/CD
- **Regular Dependency Updates** via Dependabot
- **License Compliance** checking

#### Code Security
- **Static Code Analysis** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Secret Detection** to prevent credential leaks
- **Code Signing** for releases

## 🔍 Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monthly dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly security reviews
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Container image updates

## 🚀 Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Deployment**: Use HTTPS in production
3. **Network Security**: Deploy behind firewall/VPN if needed
4. **Access Control**: Implement authentication for sensitive environments

### For Developers
1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose stack traces
4. **Logging**: Log security events appropriately

## 📋 Known Security Considerations

### PlantUML Processing
- **Diagram Content**: PlantUML processes user-provided text
- **Resource Limits**: Implemented to prevent DoS via complex diagrams
- **Sandboxing**: PlantUML runs in isolated container environment

### Data Privacy
- **No Persistent Storage**: Diagrams are not stored on server
- **Session Data**: Minimal session information retained
- **Analytics**: No tracking implemented by default

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
```env
# Security settings
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production
SERVER_SSL_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
```

### Nginx Security Headers
```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```
